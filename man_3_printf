.SH CONVERSION
.B d, i
.br
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.

.B c
.br
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

.B s
.br
If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

.B %
.br
A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
